                <p>
                I don’t know when you became home.<br>
                There was no announcement.<br>
                No dramatic moment.<br><br>

                Just one day I realized my nervous system rests better knowing you exist.<br><br>

                You don’t overwhelm my life.<br>
                You steady it.<br>
                And that might be the most romantic thing anyone has ever done to me.<br><br>

                Loving you doesn’t feel like chaos or urgency.<br>
                It feels like recognition.<br>
                Like something ancient in me nodding quietly and saying,<br>
                <i>yes… this.</i><br><br>

                I don’t love you loudly 🫣<br>
                I love you honestly.<br>
                In the way I think of you during ordinary moments 🤗🫶🏼<br>
                In the way my future feels less frightening with your name in it.<br><br>

                On your birthday, I won’t promise forever in dramatic words.<br>
                But I will say this—<br>
                there is something in me that chooses you without effort,<br>
                again and again,<br>
                and trusts time enough to let destiny unfold gently.<br><br>

                I hope this year gives you everything you’ve been carrying silently.<br>
                May all your dreams come true,<br>
                may you stay in the pink of health and receive abundance of wealth 🥰<br><br>

                And if I get to walk beside you through even a part of it,<br>
                I’ll consider myself quietly lucky 🥺♥️
