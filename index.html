      <p>
        I don’t know when you became home.<br>
        There was no announcement.<br>
        No dramatic moment.<br>
        Just one day I realized my nervous system rests better knowing you exist.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don’t overwhelm my life.<br>
        You steady it.<br>
        And that might be the most romantic thing anyone has ever done to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Loving you doesn’t feel like chaos or urgency.<br>
        It feels like recognition.<br>
        Like something ancient in me nodding quietly and saying,<br>
        <em>yes… this.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t love you loudly 🫣<br>
        I love you honestly.<br>
        In the way I think of you during ordinary moments 🤗🫶🏼<br>
        In the way my future feels less frightening with your name in it.
      </p>

      <p>
        On your birthday, I won’t promise forever in dramatic words.<br>
        But I will say this —
      </p>

      <p>
        There is something in me that chooses you without effort,<br>
        again and again,<br>
        and trusts time enough to let destiny unfold gently.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hope this year gives you everything you’ve been carrying silently.<br>
        May all your dreams come true, may you stay in pink of health,<br>
        and receive abundance of wealth 🥰
      </p>

      <p>
        And if I get to walk beside you through even a part of it,<br>
        I’ll consider myself quietly lucky 🥺♥️
      </p>
